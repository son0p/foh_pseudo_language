* A pseudo language for structured knowledge about FOH (Front of House) audio and mental activities

** Data Types
*** audioStream

    Finite duration flux of analog or digital audio signal related to an event, writable by operators, controlStream's, soundGenerator's, readable by spectator, blackhole, feedback, musicalError, glith, etc.

*** controlStream

    finite flux of data intended to operate over an audioStream

*** Group

Non empty set with at least one internal operation (addition), and an inverse element (mute). 

*** spectactor

    animated acoustic absorbers, readable as audioStream

*** crew

    Humans with different talents organized in a hierarchical system

**** roadies
     audioStream guards

**** production manager
     can block or unblock master audioStream, conector with in-situ provider of audio tools
*** audioChain
*** blackHole

    receptor of an audioStream inaudible to spectators. eg: audioStream <helpMic>

*** dinamicRange
*** coberture
*** lowFreqDispertion

Acoustic densities fenomenology at south of the spectrum, noticeable on the skin

*** audioSpots
    geolocable zones valuable as  acoustic-turist attraction
**** powerAlley
     corridor not suitable for people sensible to lowFreqDispertion
*** stageLekage
*** bus
*** matrix
*** subGroup

    consolidate operable audioStreams

*** VCA

    execute domain in audioStream(s)  level(s) via controlStream

*** glitch
*** feedback
    recursive induction of self audioStream where the amplified version of the audioStream surpass the source audioStream.
*** musicalError
*** userCookies
*** importance

    subjetive valoration  writable by audioStream, controlStream, spectator, manager, etc

*** moneyChannel

    audioStream whith highest importance calculated by spectator, manager, and soloist.

*** Reactionist

    entities that use the reaction as their main behavior, do not take the time to reflect on the situation. 
    
** Operators
*** mix

    add or subtrac  importance in audioStreams

*** append

    open new audioStream

*** process

    An instance who execute instructions and can have multiple threads who can be concurrent.

*** mute

    The art of kill an audioStream

*** route

    set up statics routes to specific ports, host, networks, readable by audioStream

*** duplicate
*** align
*** unAlign
*** equalize
*** deformFrequencyResponse
*** deformTimeResponse
*** distract
** Control structures
*** gainStructure

    Aim to preserve the dinamicRange in an audioChain

*** compress
*** expand
*** compensate
*** panic [boolean]

    when TRUE trigger a priority on moneyChannel and apply force to make everthing else ignorable.
*** Environment Variables
**** Initialization

     For each new state is required to operator to initialize the value of participant variables, in decreasing importances until time avaliable is extingished

*** Score

    Graphical representation of how an aural environment evolves in time

*** Resiliense
** functions
*** contextConformation
**** Monitor Network bootstrap

     Pink noise homogeneous distribution in all mixes 
     -10db of all audioStreams in all mixes
     0db for focal subject

*** contextTransformation
*** highlight
*** mask
*** backendBlurr
*** moneyChannel
*** faderRide
*** mutilate
*** manyToOne / oneToMany

    transit between distant sources and near sources.ej: disturb the balance between room mics and short field mics in a drumkit. / functions on master bus.

*** reSignificate

    momentary or permanent use of abnormal balance contrary to common sense.

*** southArt

    any sofisticated use of entitys below 80hz

*** snakeAlucination

    in homenage to the people who occupy the strait line between the FOH and stage, stereo extravagances.

*** dualMono
*** heyMister

    abandonation of the console in order to respond a distract query of a spectator

*** belowRadar

    find the minimun level of a entity

*** eliminateComparison
*** fastBuildUp
*** watchDog

    dinamicRange survelliance in search of rules violators, can eat userCookies 
*** prepareForNext
    for each Evironment Variable 
      do initialize until avaliable time end
*** scoreReader

    Dictates next highlight in a time series score
    while( time state rolling )
      eval time
        query next highlight
          call operator attention 
            cue call bar countdown
*** errorTail
    must activate resiliense tools to recover concentration

** test
*** Survey your tools
*** Reach your goals
**** Tactic functions
*** Filling a hole
